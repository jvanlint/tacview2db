# SOLID Principles Assessment and Refactoring Tasks
After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several areas that could be improved to better align with SOLID principles.

## Current SOLID Violations
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Model classes are handling data persistence (database writing) alongside their data representation roles
- tacview_engine.py handles file system operations, progress tracking, and business logic orchestration
### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Adding new data sources would require modifying existing code rather than extending it
- Processing logic is not easily extensible for new file formats or data types
### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Not explicitly violated, but there's limited inheritance structure to evaluate
### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- No formal interfaces defined, making client requirements less clear
- Database functionality is not segregated into focused interfaces
### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules directly depend on low-level modules (direct database coupling)
- Concrete implementations rather than abstractions are used throughout

## High-Level Refactoring Tasks
#### 1. Implement Database Dependency Injection

- Create a database interface/abstraction layer
- Implement concrete database classes (SQLite implementation)
- Refactor code to depend on the interface rather than concrete implementation
- Update service initialization to inject database dependencies

#### 2. Separate Data Models from Data Access

- Remove database operations from model classes
- Implement repository pattern for data access
- Create repositories for each entity type (Mission, Event, Primary, Secondary, Parent)

#### 3. Restructure Service Layer

- Separate file processing from business logic
- Create dedicated services for XML parsing, data extraction, and data storage
- Implement service interfaces to allow for alternative implementations

#### 4. Implement Domain Service Interfaces

- Define interfaces for core services (TacviewProcessor, MissionProcessor)
- Allow for pluggable implementations of processing strategies
- Enable testing with mock implementations

#### 5. Improve Error Handling and Reporting

- Implement proper exception handling with custom exception types
- Separate logging concerns from business logic
- Provide meaningful feedback throughout the processing pipeline

#### 6. Extract File System Operations

- Create a dedicated file service interface
- Implement concrete file system operations
- Allow for alternative file source implementations (local, remote, etc.)

#### 7. Create Progress Tracking Abstraction

- Separate progress reporting from processing logic
- Create an interface for progress tracking
- Allow for different progress display implementations (CLI, GUI, silent)

#### 8. Implement Configuration Management

- Extract hardcoded values to configuration objects
- Allow for runtime configuration changes
- Support different configuration sources (files, environment variables)

#### 9. Implement Proper Unit Testing

- Create tests for each isolated component
- Use dependency injection to facilitate mock objects
- Test business logic independently from external dependencies

#### 10. Refactor XML Processing

- Create dedicated parsers for different sections of the XML
- Allow for alternative XML processing strategies
- Separate XML schema knowledge from business logic

These tasks would significantly improve the application's adherence to SOLID principles, making it more maintainable, testable, and extensible for future enhancements.
